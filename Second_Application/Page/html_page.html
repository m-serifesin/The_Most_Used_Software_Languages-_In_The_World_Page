    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p> <i>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It's made of keywords and commands that web designers use for creating websites. 

        Hypertext is text with links that readers can simply click on to go to another page or another part of the page. Meanwhile, markup language uses tags or plain text with special markings to define the sections of a page, such as headers and footers, and other elements, including tables and images.
        
        HTML is considered one of the three essential tools in webpage creation: HTML provides the structure or the way text, pictures, and so on will appear on the website. CSS (cascading style sheets) sets the visual properties of these elements, such as colors, format, and layout. Meanwhile, Javascript makes these elements behave in certain ways depending on a user's action. For example, the font size of text can increase when users hover their mouse or click a button on a page.
        
        To write HTML, you'll need a text editor, like Notepad, Brackets, or Atom. HTML editors make sure your coding is clean and functional. They help reduce errors by automatically inserting tags (auto-completion) and other common elements or through debugging.  </i></p>
